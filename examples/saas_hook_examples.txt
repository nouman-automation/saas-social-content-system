Generate strong SAAS hooks like this:

- Your product isn’t the problem. Your message is.
- Most SAAS startups fail—not because of a bad idea, but because of weak positioning.
- If your landing page can’t explain your offer in 5 seconds, you lost the customer.
- Stop talking about features—start solving problems.
- Selling software? Start educating, not advertising.
